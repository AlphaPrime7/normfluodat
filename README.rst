## normfluodat

- This is the python version of the famous R package normfluodbf 1.5.2.
- This python aims to reach a broader audience but silmautaneously serves as a conduit for me to understand how to publish packages in python.
- Normfluodbf is deceptively named and so the python ambition will break the R version into 2 modules, 1 named normfluodbf used on DBF files, normfluodat used on DAT files and a version combining both normfluostar for both DBF and DAT files.
- The package is designed to read data from liposome flux assays but researchers might find it useful in other experiments.
- Please reach out with a THANKS or to report changes to the instrument's data that might warrant some updates to the software.

## Current State

- I am still ramping up on understanding python package setups and developer tools so this repository is for normfluodat.
- Once this project gets me up to speed on developing python modules, I know there will be more problems to solve after that.
