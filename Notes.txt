What do i need in python to make a package?delivery system for this is normfluodbf
Source code
CLI control
tests (tox or unittests, more??)
A packaging system (setuptools, poetry)
Documentation (docs)- the tricky part when it comes to complex documentation (tox?, sphinx, base)

#MANIFEST.ini
#setup.py should have all the files needed for the program to run (modules, pkgs, scripts, etc.)
#clarification about files to add or exclude requires the manifest (like a shipping manifest)
#normally i add tests, readme.rst, docs and data files for testing.

#SETUPTOOLS COMPLEXITIES
#toml, setup and cfg files provide varying levels of setup customization
#setup is perfect for simple projects and works with cfg in simple projects
#toml is called in when we go into more complex module setups.
